# Drawing-and-Guessing-Game
Just your typical Drawing and Guessing game following in the footsteps of creations like skribble.io etc. Project is made in python mainly to practice some socket programming.
Click on the 'file' button in the toolbar and then click on "New word - You paint!" to get a word from the server and then you can draw. Meanwhile other people can guess. Color of the brush can be changed from the few color panels in the top right box.
