# Drawing-and-Guessing-Game
Just your typical Drawing and Guessing game following in the footsteps of creations like skribble.io etc. Project is made in python mainly to practice some socket programming.

Click on the 'file' button in the toolbar and then click on "New word - You paint!" to get a word from the server and then you can draw. Meanwhile other people can guess. Color of the brush can be changed from the few color panels in the top right box. 

Note: This is an unfinished project. No scoring system or round robin system has been added, although it is fairly simple to include if you feel like you want to go ahead with completing it. The client does bug out sometimes when a new word is requested. I don't know what causes the bug.
